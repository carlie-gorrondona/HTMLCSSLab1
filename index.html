    <h1>Taking Care of Your New House Plants</h1>

    <p>So you've bought your first house plant. You may be asking yourself "Now what?". Determing your new plant's care. That's what! Your first step to plant care is determing your plant type.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Plant Type</h3>

    The first step to taking care of your new house plant is first determining the type. This is important because different plant types have different needs. For instance, an ivy will require frequent waterings compared to a succulent. Most plants are sold with a tag that tells you the type and may even provide information on plant care. After referencing this tag and determining the type, the next step is to select your new plant's location. See the table below for a few examples of plant types and their needs.</p>

    <table border ="2" class="center">
        <tr>
            <th>Plant Image</th>
            <th>Plant Type</th>
            <th>Light Needs</th>
            <th>Watering Needs</th>
            <th>Feeding Needs</th>
        </tr>

    <h3>Step 2: Plant Location</h3>
    
    <p>Plant location is extremely important especially for lighting and humidity. When placing a plant in your home, make sure it is placed in a location based on its light requirements. Some plants need direct sunlight, so they will need to be placed in a location that receives enough sun. Most house plants only require indirect sunlight, so you can get away with keeping them inside. For these plants, the lighting inside your home is sufficient. Meeting humidity requirements can be more challenging. Most indoor house plants require a slightly humid environment, and this can be a challenge if you live in a dry climate. An easy way to care for a plant's humidity needs is to spray it with water once or twice a day. Another method is to fill up a tray with pebbles and fill it with water. Place the plant on top of the pebbles and the water from the tray will evaporate and provide humidity. </p>

    <h3>Step 3: Plant Watering and Feeding Schedule</h3>

    <p>Setting up a watering schedule for your plant can help keep you on track with care and avoid wilting or leaf browning (common causes of underwatered house plants). You can create a calendar that highlights the days when the plant will need water. You can check your plant's tag to determine how often waterings are needed and then notate the dates on the calendar. For plant feedings, most plants need feedings on a monthly to trimonthly basis. This info can also be notated on your calendar if you feel you will forget. Keep in mind that during winter months, plants will need fewer waterings and feedings compared to other seasons. During the winter months, it can be very easy to overfeed and/or overwater your plant, so keep that in mind when notating your calendar.</p>
